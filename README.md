## Notes

* Used strict(ish) TDD to guide development process - [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) / [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
* Built from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) template
* Experimented with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) throughout to hold state in function components
